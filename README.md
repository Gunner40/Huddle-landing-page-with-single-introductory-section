## Overview

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Background images

- if background-size is set to COVER, the image will always cover the entire element and it will maintain its aspect ratio. However if necessary it may be CLIPPED, resulting in the whole image not being shown.

- if set to a PERCENTAGE, eg background-size: 100% 100%, the image will cover the entire element (or whatever percentage we specify, here its 100%) but may be stretched (if necessary). The whole image will be shown but the original aspect ratio might not be maintained resulting in a stretched (or squashed) image.
